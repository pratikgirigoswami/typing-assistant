# Typing Assistant - A Next Word Predictor
Predicting the next word while user is typing is also called Language Modeling. It is one of the major tasks of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has numerous applications. In this project, the idea of transfer learning to predict the next word from the typed words is employed. The proposed method is based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) is also developed for better user experience where a user can type at least three words and get suggested next word on the same interface.
